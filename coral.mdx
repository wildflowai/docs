# Why?

Billions of years of evolution created Earth's **vibrant ecosystems** – they are inconceivably rich\! We have so much to learn from this **beautiful complexity**. We want to build a future where **humans and nature thrive** and enrich each other. That’s why we chose to **start with** **coral reefs**. They are the **most complex, beautiful, endangered, and important ecosystem**. They are home to 25% of marine life while occupying only 0.1% of the ocean. Sadly, we’re on track to lose 90% of coral reefs by 2050\. The time to act is now. Over half a billion people rely on coral reefs. Already vulnerable communities are the first to suffer the consequences. We have to make **a lot of critical decisions** about them\!

# How?

**Wildflow Coral** is our first product. We take all the **data across all modalities**, such as 3D photogrammetry, bioacoustics, underwater videos, remote sensing, eDNA, environmental data like currents, and more, to create the **ultimate digital twin of any coral reef ecosystem** and make it available to the world. And we do it at a planetary scale.

# What?

This enables deep **modelling of complex ecosystem dynamics**, such as population dynamics, predator-prey dynamics, energy transfer, and phenological events (like spawning), and computes the ecosystem's health and resilience metrics. Via rigorous analysis of multimodal data, it uncovers **precise mechanisms driving ecosystem change**, offering humans irrefutable **evidence to steer** their **actions**. It shows quantitatively how coastal development, agriculture runoff, invasive species, pollution, increasing water temperatures, and other **pressures affect the coral** reef ecosystem. It shows what the coral reef **ecosystem gives us back** through its services, such as coastal area protection and oxygen production. It coordinates conservation and restoration efforts worldwide. We know which practises work and which don’t. It **guides human activities** to **understand**, **protect** **and** **restore** **coral reef ecosystems**.

# For whom?

**Example**: a new **hotel** **is being developed**, which causes more **nutrients** to end up in the **water**, leading to an **algal bloom**. Larvae of the crown-of-thorns **starfish** (COTS) love eating algae, so their **population skyrockets**, **damaging** local coral **reefs**. The local **economy plummets**. The newly built **hotel can’t attract tourists** any more. **Fisheries cannot catch fish** because there are no fish anymore. Coastal **communities** face a cascade of **challenges**, from **economic instability** to **food insecurity** and increased vulnerability to **natural disasters**.

**Billions of people** and **dollars** depend on **our ability** to understand, protect and restore **coral reef ecosystems**. At the forefront of this battle are:

- Environmental NGOs and **conservation/restoration organisations** who need to monitor reef health holistically, optimise conservation/restoration practices, **prove ROI to donors**, and **maximise the impact** of their work.

- **Philanthropic organisations** **and foundations** (and others who fund conservation and restoration) need to identify high-impact projects and **allocate resources** more effectively using data-driven insights from the digital twin. Without the ability to understand coral ecosystems, we can't truly unlock projects, so **billions are waiting or, in fact, wasted**.

- **Coastal communities** and local governments need to protect their livelihoods.

- **Governments and policymakers** need to develop and roll out effective, precise environmental policies to protect nature (similar to biodiversity net gain, SBTN, TNFD, etc).

- **Research institutions** need to accelerate scientific discovery by harnessing the power of AI-driven analysis of massive datasets.

- **Insurance companies** need to gain precise risk assessment tools for coastal properties and marine assets.

- **Coastal tourism** boards need to protect their most valuable natural asset, ensuring the long-term health of their economies.

- **Citizen scientists** and diving enthusiasts are looking for a way to contribute meaningfully to reef protection, enriching the global model with their observations.

For the first time, **we could become the generation** that actually **leaves behind nature better than we found it**.
