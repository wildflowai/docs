## Features

### Data Ingestion & Standardization

The platform accepts diverse data types such as **eDNA**, **bioacoustics**, **computer vision**, **remote sensing**, and more. All data is standardized, paving the way for universally applicable machine learning models.

### Supplemental Data & Collaboration

We incorporate additional data sources like **satellite** data, **weather** data, **genomics** data and **taxonomy**. Our platform fosters collaboration by simplifying data ingestion, sharing, and exporting to tools like R and Python Pandas.

### Tools & Visualization

We provide quality control tools and a visualization layer to streamline analysis and promote insights.

## Applications

![wildflow-applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildflowai/.github/main/profile/wildflow-applications.svg)

Our platform supports various applications, including:

- [creation of marine protected areas (MPAs)](/applications/marine-protected-areas),
- [impact assessment of offshore wind farms](/applications/wind-farms),
- pet food fish procurement,
- invasive species opportunities,
- seaweed farm monitoring,
- [coral bleaching events prediction](/applications/coral-bleaching),
- monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) for biodiversity,
- [biodiversity credits](/applications/biodiversity-credits), and
- [harmful algae bloom forecasts](/applications/algae-blooms).

Now also is a good time to leverage foundation models for enhanced biodiversity studies ðŸ˜‰

We welcome contributions to this mission of ocean conservation. Join us! ðŸ¤—
