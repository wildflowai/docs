This is a timeline for our first product Wildflow Coral.

We've got already a few terabytes of coral reef 3D photogrammetry data from 3 universities and the world’s largest reef restoration effort. Established connections with major research institutions, 3D data pipeline organisations, data collecting companies, restoration projects and reef analytics research groups.

<Steps>
  <Step title="3D reef platform (in 6 months)">
    Rapidly launch open 3D reef data platform, hosting existing high-resolution
    photogrammetry datasets from top research labs. Simultaneously, develop
    tools for visualising and labelling these massive 3D models (over 100GBs
    each) in the browser. Develop an open API to run analytics pipelines against
    all our data, allowing researchers from all over the world to collaborate on
    these models. This establishes Wildflow as the go-to hub for reef data and
    generates immediate interest. Conduct a survey (a public catalogue) to
    locate existing coral reef datasets to integrate (for other modalities).
    Secure an initial paying client, showcasing the platform's value in
    monitoring restoration efforts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI-powered, multimodal reef intelligence (in 1 year)">
    Expand the data platform to integrate multimodal data sources like
    acoustics, videos, eDNA, satellite imagery, and environmental data. Develop
    AI models that understand and integrate all multimodal data inputs alongside
    the existing 3D data. Classify species, assess benthic cover, and estimate
    reef health using mechanistic models (e.g. for biodiversity credits). Start
    training the first multimodal foundation models for biodiversity (two
    modalities first). Target conservation and restoration projects as early
    clients. Partner with dive centres for citizen science data collection
    (starting with 3D models), further enriching the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Comprehensive “digital twin” of coral reefs (in 2 years)">
    Develop comprehensive digital twins of coral reefs, modelling ecosystem
    dynamics (connectivity, predator-prey, phenological events, etc), human
    impacts (management of invasive species like COTS or lionfish, stony coral
    tissue loss disease (SCTLD) propagation, etc.), and valuating ecosystem
    services. This “digital twin” enables "what-if" scenario modelling and
    guides targeted interventions. Expand to other markets beyond
    conservation/restoration projects. Many people have started building their
    own applications on top of Wildflow Coral. Coral reefs around the world are
    starting to revive!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Beyond coral reefs (in 5 years)">
    Expand our tech to adjacent ecosystems like oyster reefs and seagrass
    meadows. Wildflow Coral’s modular architecture, along with its proven AI
    capabilities and insights into critical marine habitats, further refine our
    ability to model complex interactions within the ocean's interconnected web
    of life.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Beyond oceans (in 10 years)">
    We have AI models that comprehensively understand all ecosystems on our
    planet. We built a strong “digital nervous system for our planet”. We
    aligned all human activities with our understanding of nature. We found a
    balance between humans and nature. We empower each other!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Beyond Earth (in 20 years)">
    We have superhuman abilities to create a jungle out of any desert (a truly
    functioning ecosystem). We can even terraform Mars now!
