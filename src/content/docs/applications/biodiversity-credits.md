:::tip[Main idea]
Our platform centralizes the acquisition of key biodiversity data, including derived metrics like reef rugosity, coral cover, and fish species richness, ensuring its accuracy. While we don't directly sell biodiversity credits, we offer companies an API to compute these metrics/credits seamlessly. This API is designed to handle both private and open data, allowing for the merging of diverse data combinations to derive insightful conclusions.

In the face of pressing environmental challenges, sustainable solutions are becoming paramount.

**Carbon credits**: For climate change, the world uses carbon credits to set a benchmark. However, these credits, while pivotal, have faced criticisms for sometimes acting as a cover-up for environmentally harmful activities rather than genuinely offsetting them.

**Nitrogen credits**: In contrast, nitrogen credits are viewed more favorably due to their localized nature and direct impact. They allow businesses to counterbalance nitrogen releases by supporting nitrogen-reducing practices.

**Biodiversity credits**: Now, as biodiversity loss comes to the forefront, there's a need for a similar, yet more refined system. Biodiversity credits (see the [OpWall](https://www.opwall.com/biodiversity-credits) example) are emerging as an answer. Instead of offsetting damage, which often doesn't result in genuine restoration or conservation, the goal is to encourage meaningful enhancement of biodiversity. Opwall's concept is akin to the _Retail Price Index (RPI)_, where a _'basket of metrics'_ determines biodiversity progression.

## The problem

Creating a robust and meaningful system for biodiversity credits requires centralized and standardized metrics. Yet, the challenge remains: how can diverse and vast data be consistently measured, updated, and made accessible?

## Our solution

**wildflow** specializes in gathering time-series geospatial biodiversity data from diverse sources including eDNA, bioacoustics, remote sensing, manual observations, and computer vision.

We provide:

- **Centralized data collection:** Companies can access comprehensive information directly. From satellite imagery and weather data to taxonomy, we simplify the data procurement process.
- **Open-source and open-data paradigm:** Our commitment to transparency and collaboration ensures data accessibility and verifiability. This aligns with transparency initiatives like the [TNFD](https://tnfd.global/).
- **Ease of calculating biodiversity indices:** With vast data sources at our disposal, we can effortlessly compute any biodiversity index, offering this as a ready-to-use solution for companies. Our platform supports both private and open data, presenting opportunities to merge and sell insightful data combinations.
- **Supporting biodiversity credits:** With standard biodiversity metrics, we offer companies an efficient API to engage with biodiversity credits. Consider metrics like reef rugosity, coral cover, or fish species richness; we centralize the acquisition of such data, ensuring accuracy.

Whether youâ€™re a researcher, conservationist, or a marine enthusiast, we invite you to join our mission and make waves of positive impact together!
