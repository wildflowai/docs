Advancing the creation and maintenance of MPAs through efficient data infrastructure.
:::

Marine biodiversity forms the lifeblood of our planet, and our mission is to expedite the research and conservation processes that protect it. By bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights, we aim to serve as the primary toolbox for biodiversity researchers and organizations dedicated to the protection of marine ecosystems.

## The challenge of MPA creation

Establishing an MPA involves intricate negotiations and collaboration with governments. It often demands extensive back-and-forth discussions to align conservation goals with regional interests. For nonprofits working on the frontlines, this process is challenging enough without the added burden of data analysis. Currently, **they spend up to a year analyzing diverse data** from satellite telemetry, bioacoustics, manual observations, and more. The aim is to understand species distributions, identify crucial habitats, and subsequently propose MPA boundaries.

In today's landscape, biodiversity researchers must not only excel in understanding nature and addressing the biodiversity crisis, but they also need to master big data management. This includes building data pipelines, aggregating data from various sources, cleaning data, handling extensive big data operations and deploying novel models for multi-model data formats.

## Our solution

Our platform aims to streamline this process. By offering cloud-based distributed workflows tailored for MPA creation and maintenance, we help nonprofits iterate faster with governments, reducing the time and resources spent on data analysis.

By transforming various data types into time-series geospatial biodiversity data, we provide a unified, accessible model for swift decision-making.

Our platform based on an [open-source](https://github.com/wildflowai) ([MIT licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)) and primarily open data model. This ensures full transparency, enabling users to review, adapt, and even deploy these tools independently if desired.

## A partnership approach

While our platform serves a wide range of needs, our primary goal is to accelerate marine conservation. We plan to work with large corporates, tapping into their resources, with a vision to reinvest in conservation initiatives. This partnership approach ensures that we garner funds to empower nonprofits and conservationists in their MPA endeavors, allowing them to focus on the ground-level work that truly matters.

## The future of MPAs

With the impending [UN High Seas Treaty](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64839763) aimed at protecting **30% of the world's oceans by 2030**, the urgency for more MPAs is palpable. Our platform, armed with its vast open data capabilities, stands ready to play a pivotal role, especially in pioneering high-sea MPAs.

Analyzing the movements of megafauna is critical. Projects like [Megamove](https://megamove.org) underscore the potential of big-data approaches in decoding these patterns, and our platform is purpose-built to further such research.

## Supporting developing nations

Overfishing is a pressing issue in many developing countries, affecting both the marine life and the people dependent on it. Setting up protected marine areas can help restore these ecosystems and boost the local economy. We're keen to collaborate with nonprofits in these areas, providing our tech tools to make the process more efficient and impactful.

## Join us!

We're determined to drive change, harnessing our expertise and resources for a brighter marine future. Whether you're a researcher, conservationist, or a marine enthusiast, we invite you to join our mission and make waves of positive impact together.
