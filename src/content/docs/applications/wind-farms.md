:::tip[Our primary objective]
To offer a holistic view of the environmental implications of offshore wind farms, emphasizing marine biodiversity, through robust multi-modal biodiversity data.

## The problem

Offshore wind farms, while a promising source of clean energy, have potential effects on marine ecosystems. Their construction and operation can potentially affect marine ecosystems, bird migratory routes, alter underwater soundscapes, lead to habitat distructions and the broader biodiversity implications. Understanding these impacts is paramount to ensure sustainable energy development without compromising marine biodiversity.

## Our solution

Our platform stands out due to its ability to integrate a rich array of biodiversity data from varied sources. This multi-modal data aggregation approach — encompassing eDNA, remote sensing, bioacoustics, and more — gives us a unique edge:

- **Fuller picture:** While some entities might focus on a single data source like eDNA, our approach collates information from diverse avenues. This multi-faceted perspective ensures that our impact assessments are comprehensive, providing a fuller understanding of the ecosystem dynamics.
- **Collaboration with wind farms:** Many offshore wind farm operators undertake extensive assessments around their turbines, generating a wealth of data. By collaborating with these entities, we extract valuable biodiversity insights from this often underutilized data.
- **Open-source and open-data approach:** We believe in being open and honest. This makes wind farm companies more willing to share their data with us. Sharing this way fits well with efforts like the [TNFD](https://tnfd.global/), which encourages clear reporting about the impact on nature.

These assessments can shed light on:

- Disruptions to migratory patterns of marine species.
- Effects on marine mammal behaviors and communication.
- Changes to local biodiversity and ecosystem structures.

Using our platform, people can make better decisions, finding a balance between creating energy and looking after marine life and birds.

We're always looking to work with researchers, conservationists, and those in the energy industry. By working together, we can find the best way to use wind energy without harming the environment.

If our mission resonates with you or if you think we could work together, we'd love to hear from you!
