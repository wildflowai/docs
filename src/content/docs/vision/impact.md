## Impact

Our core focus is **pioneering large AI models tailored for biodiversity**. Like foundation models (FM) for biodiversity. See [FM for ecology](https://www.authorea.com/users/699564/articles/686860-foundation-models-in-shaping-the-future-of-ecology) and [MIT course on FM](https://www.futureofai.mit.edu/)). There’s no single _“biodiversity modelling”_ or _“data tools for biodiversity”_ market to target, so we need to create it. However, almost everything is down the stream of nature! Moving towards our vision will profoundly impact many things. See examples below. **Note**: not all of them are the focus of **wildflow**.

- **conservation**: creation and monitoring of marine protected areas (MPAs) **(working prototype)**, forecast coral bleaching events **(exploring)**
- **restoration**: oyster reefs, seagrass meadows, mangroves **(strong leads)**
- **aquaculture**: optimal farm placement, growth monitoring, and yield optimisation for industries like seaweed farming **(exploring)**
- **invasive species**: early detection and management strategies **(previous job experience)**
- **offshore energy**: biodiversity assessments for offshore wind farms **(lead)**
- **mining**: environmental impact mitigation in e.g. lithium extraction **(lead)**
- **fisheries**: sustainable fish stocks management, reducing bycatch **(todo)**
- **fishery byproducts**: in sustainable sourcing and traceability for industries like pet food manufacturing **(exploring)**
- **biodiversity credits** and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) **(leads)**
- **climate change**: carbon sequestration assessment and monitoring of blue carbon ecosystems **(todo)**
- **biotech/pharmaceuticals**: discovering and monitoring marine genetic resources **(todo)**
- **shipping**: environmental impact minimisation, port sustainability **(todo)**
- **governments**: policy-making, environmental regulation compliance, and sustainable resource management **(todo)**

We won’t have to do all the applications ourselves! Similar to how everyone is now building things on top of ChatGPT (or integrating OpenAI’s APIs), our models will create enormous opportunities.

Multiple businesses will **integrate our models and tools**, making industries like energy extraction more sustainable (improving the “**act**” part of cybernetic loops).

Similarly, businesses specialising in sensing solutions would have more users (improving the “**measure**” part of cybernetic loops). This will empower local tech providers (e.g. Gérard Zinzindohoué) or drone freelancers as they would have **a place to sell their data**.

## Why now?

The crisis is becoming bigger and bigger, also:

- Significant **breakthroughs in AI research** and maturity of data infra.
- More **demands** from the **public** and more **policies** appear. E.g. [UN High Seas Treaty](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64839763) was signed (protecting 30% of the oceans by 2030).
