## We can’t live without nature

Natural ecosystem services provide benefits of [**$125-140T**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378014000685) **per year** (global GDP is [~$100T](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp)). The oceans represent over 99% of the living space on Earth ([NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/focus-areas/climate-variability-and-change/ocean-physics/oceanography/), [UNESCO](https://oceanliteracy.unesco.org/ocean-exploration/)). They are vast! It’s unclear how many species live in the oceans exactly ([NOAA](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-species.html)), but we know it’s at least [245k](https://www.marinespecies.org/) and more to be discovered. Oceans hold [**78% of animal**](https://ourworldindata.org/life-by-environment) **biomass** (and only [1% of total](https://oceanliteracy.unesco.org/ocean-exploration/) biomass due to plants and fungi). They are vital for the planet's health, with an asset value exceeding **$24 trillion** ([WWF](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/sustainable-blue-economy-finance-principles), [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/transformation-sustainability-economic-imperative-to-revive-our-oceans)) through fisheries, seagrass, mangroves, transportation, coastlines, and CO2 removal capabilities. Oceans produce at least **50% of all oxygen** ([WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/did-you-know/does-the-ocean-produce-oxygen/), [UN](https://www.un.org/en/observances/oceans-day)), capture **31% of all CO2** ([NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/quantifying-ocean-carbon-sink) [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau5153)), and are a vital source of protein for **over a billion people** ([UN](https://www.un.org/en/observances/oceans-day)).

## The ocean is dying

We [**lost 69%**](https://www.livingplanetindex.org/) **of living things** on the planet over the past 50 years. We kill [~**100M sharks** per year](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308597X13000055). Over **300k whales and dolphins** die just from entanglement in fishing nets each year ([WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/bycatch)). The Great Pacific Garbage Patch full of **plastic is** [**1.6M km^2**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) (more than France + Italy + Spain combined). Bottom **trawlers wipe out 8M km^2** per year ([ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080215121207.htm), [SeaSpiracy](https://www.seaspiracy.org/facts)), comparable to the size of Brazil. What we do is devastating!
