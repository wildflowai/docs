While technological advancements and economic growth are essential and invaluable, we must **align our goals** and **stop planetary-level self-destructive behaviour to survive and thrive**. To establish a **healthy balance** between humans and nature, we must **conserve/restore more** and **destroy less**.

Our limited understanding of the incredibly complex natural world is one of the biggest challenges. We need to **deeply understand** **how nature functions**, **how we impact nature**, and **how nature impacts us** to align our goals properly. We must increase our communication bandwidth with nature and **give nature/ocean ecosystems a voice**. And we need to do this faster.

## Sci-fi Vision

Imagine all the sensing solutions we have in the world **measuring** nature (like underwater cameras, bioacoustics devices, eDNA, remote sensing, etc). The data from these sensors is analysed and understood (aka **modelled)**, e.g. someone runs an ecological niche modelling, forecasts harmful algae bloom, etc. Then, based on this information, someone **acts** in the real world (e.g. creates a marine protected area, installs an offshore wind farm, restores coral reef, etc).

You can imagine these pathways of how the data flows from e.g. a video camera of some BRUVs technician into a CSV of a data analyst, some other system, and a PDF report in the hands of a policy maker, etc.

Each pathway usually follows **measure -> model -> act** steps known as a cybernetic loop. E.g. if you touch a hot pan and instantly snatch your hand away, that’s you following precisely the same cybernetic loop steps. The difference is that for you, it takes milliseconds, but our environmental response takes years.

All these pathways/cybernetic loops form a massive **digital nervous system of our planet**, connecting sensing solutions to real-world actions, where the modelling part is responsible for making decisions. We need to accelerate these feedback loops and strengthen this digital nervous system. If terrible things happen to turtles, we react straightaway, not in 5 years!

Imagine we (humanity) accelerated research to the point when the modelling part of the digital nervous system became a **mega AI brain** (which could just be a distributed collection of models). This brain **comprehensively understands complex ecosystems** with all their intricate dynamics and interactions happening under the hood. It can model population and predator-prey dynamics and predict phenological events like coral spawning. It can provide a detailed analysis of all **ecosystem services** and understand **ecosystem functions**. It quantifies the ecosystem's health and can tell us where it “hurts” the most, which activities cause the most “pain”, and suggests **small changes** that strengthen ecosystems and have a **profound positive impact**, growing our shared pie of global economy.

This system is **integrated everywhere** we interact with nature, from conservation organisations and academic institutions to industries and policymakers. It’s primarily based on **open-source** and **open-data** approaches, providing **transparent mechanisms** showing who and how affects nature.

## Mission

Our mission is to enable a **comprehensive understanding of nature** and **align human activities** with it, starting with **oceans**.
