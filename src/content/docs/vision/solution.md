The solution would be to **give ocean ecosystems a voice** by strengthening the planetary digital nervous system and brain. We should broaden slow **measure -> model -> act** pathways making them fast highways so that we can understand, protect and restore nature faster.

## 1\. Enable comprehensive modelling (top priority)

Enable comprehensive modelling of nature. Leverage ML and cutting-edge AI (e.g. **foundation models for biodiversity**) to extract actionable insights for an in-depth **understanding of ecosystems**, better **data utilisation** and more informed **decision-making**. This would change everything if one could **model various “what if” scenarios** regarding ocean biodiversity dynamics and human interventions!

## 2\. Operationalise models into businesses

We will create models to solve specific business use cases and ensure they are properly integrated. Our **primary revenue source** will be from **B2B business-specific models and analytics tools**. This will help us build better models and have the most impact.

We don’t want to end up in a situation where a **great AI-driven tool** for detecting **coral bleaching** events **exists** (or modelling ecosystem survises and impacts), but its **key user base** isn't aware of it, **can't use it**, or doesn't have the time/money to use it.

However, our core focus is on comprehensive modelling itself. This will create great **opportunities** for others to **create businesses** around **operationalising our models** (like Midjourney uses Stability AI's Stable Diffusion).

## 3\. Organise biodiversity data

The biggest bottleneck for us in training new models - is to have a lot of biodiversity data in one place. We need one centralised place for scattered multi-modal (tabular, video, audio…) biodiversity data, where it’s standardised and easily accessible (data platform). This solves the data fragmentation problem. Creating a data platform will accelerate research, conservation and decision-making on its own (as one can quickly access any data), and also will enable an in-depth understanding of nature, as we can utilise data better for analysis (as one can learn from 100s of datasets, not just 3).

We’ll follow these two callings: _“First: federated data networks to connect disparate ocean databases. Second: new incentives and business models for data sharing. These can create an open, actionable and equitable digital ecosystem for the sustainable future ocean”_ ([nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01668-z))

We’ll try covering all major incentives for data sharing. E.g. offshore wind farms are ready to provide their data to independent 3rd parties for transparency, which is a competitive advantage for them to win gov contracts. Academic researchers often have to publish data when publishing a research paper anyway, and they want their datasets to have more citations. NGOs sometimes buy data from neighbour NGOs (i.e. a marketplace could exist). Also, many organisations are ready to share their data in exchange for analytics and modelling. See the “getting the data” chapter below.

## 4\. Provide efficient tools

A way to eliminate data wrestling for ecologists is to provide them with cloud-based tools and infrastructure. They need convenient tools to manage, analyse and visualise the data, and also create reports (business intelligence). Example tool: combine observational and environmental data (everyone needs it). Also, ecologists need collaboration tools to share data and insights between people easily. We would build tools and infrastructure to train and deploy our models anyway. We will make them open-source and available for everyone. This will help ecologists, drive traction to our data platform/models, and accelerate overall progress.
