**Nature is dying** at unprecedented speed to the point where it becomes an **existential crisis for human civilisation**. Wildflow is on a quest to **comprehensively understand nature** and **empower humans** to make **better** **decisions** on **protecting our ecosystems**, starting with **coral reefs**. We’re building multimodal **foundation models for biodiversity**, a “brain” of the “**digital nervous system for our planet”.** This system deeply understands complex ecosystem dynamics and guides human activities, enabling **billions** to **flood into conservation/restoration**. Wildflow brings a **balance between humans and nature** and gives us the superpowers to make a **jungle out of a desert** and even **terraform Mars** in the future.
