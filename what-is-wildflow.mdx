Model biosphere. Our mission is to enable a comprehensive understanding of nature and align human activities with it, starting with oceans.

We're building a digital nervous system of the planet (in the shape of a data platform and one cloud for biodiversity), connecting sensors measuring the biosphere (eDNA, bioacoustics, computer vision, remote sensing, manual observations, etc) to actions (where to create marine protected areas, where to restore oyster reefs, where to install offshore wind farms, etc). At its core is a brain deeply understanding nature, how we impact nature, and how nature impacts us. It can forecast coral bleaching events, predict harmful algae blooms, estimate aquaculture crop yield, and more. It’s a collection of AI models, from simple statistical models to multi-modal foundation models for biodiversity, that we are pioneering. It comes as one cloud for biodiversity, an open data platform with open-source tools for data analysis and management, eliminating data wrestling for ecologists. By democratising access to AI models, biodiversity data and tools, we accelerate biodiversity research and conservation and align industrial activities with transparent mechanisms.
